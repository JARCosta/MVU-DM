I would like to thank my parents for their support, guidance and encouragement throughout my life. Without them, nothing would have been possible. For all the sacrifices they made, for the openness and love they have always shown, I am eternally grateful. my family also, my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins for their understanding and support throughout all these years.

I would also like to thank my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins for their understanding and support throughout all these years.

I would also like to acknowledge my dissertation supervisors Prof. Francisco Melo and Prof. Jo√£o Caldeira for their insight, support and sharing of knowledge that has made this Thesis possible.

Last but not least, to all my friends and colleagues that helped me grow as a person and were always there for me during the good and bad times in my life.

Thank you all.
