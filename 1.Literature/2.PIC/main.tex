\begin{abstract}
    Dimensionality reduction is a field in constant evolution. However, even though there are methods that excel at computing linear relation over datasets, the operation of linearising data points that relate non-linearly between them is a task that was not perfected yet.
    %Considering different methods to different scenarios, there are cases where the present approaches perform poorly.
    %On this study, we are going to analyse whether if it is possible for the present non-linear methods to preform accurately on datasets with vast discrepancies in data point density. More precisely, if maximum variance unfolding can preform well over disjoint manifolds.
    In this study we assess whether a powerful non-linear dimensionality reduction method, maximum variance unfolding, can be extended to datasets that lie on disjoint manifolds.
