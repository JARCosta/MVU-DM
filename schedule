May 2: buffer

- Bishop
- Make MVU runnable



TODO:

- check 1-NN class change, base line same as comparative, futurely check other class changes
    - broken swiss roll is particularly worse
- try multimple parameters, check what changes on the default methods, and eng methods ( hope that default methods get better or worse, and eng doesnt change much)
